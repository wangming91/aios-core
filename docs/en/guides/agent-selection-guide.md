## Quick Decision Tree

```
Need research/analysis? → @analyst
   ↓
Need PRD/epic? → @pm
   ↓
Need architecture? → @architect
   ↓
Need database? → @data-engineer
   ↓
Need stories? → @sm
   ↓
Need implementation? → @dev
   ↓
Need testing? → @qa

## Common Scenarios

### "I want to build a new feature"

```
1. @analyst *research - Market research
2. @pm *create-prd - Product requirements
3. @architect *create-architecture - Technical design
4. @data-engineer *create-schema - Database design
5. @sm *create-next-story - User stories
6. @dev *develop - Implementation
7. @qa *review - Quality check
8. @github-devops *create-pr - Deployment
```

### "I need to understand existing system"

```
1. @analyst *document-project - Brownfield documentation
2. @pm *create-prd (brownfield) - Document as PRD
3. @architect *create-architecture (brownfield) - Technical architecture
```

### "I want to optimize database"

```
1. @data-engineer *security-audit - Check RLS and schema
2. @data-engineer *analyze-performance hotpaths - Find bottlenecks
3. @data-engineer *create-migration-plan - Plan optimizations
4. @data-engineer *apply-migration - Apply changes
```

## Delegation Patterns (Story 6.1.2.3)

### Epic/Story Creation

- **PM creates epic** → **SM creates stories**
  ```
  @pm *create-epic         # Epic structure
  @sm *create-next-story   # Detailed stories
  ```

### Database Work

- **Architect selects DB** → **Data-engineer designs schema**
  ```
  @architect *create-architecture  # DB technology selection
  @data-engineer *create-schema    # Schema design
  ```

### Research → Product

- **Analyst researches** → **PM creates PRD**
  ```
  @analyst *research               # Market analysis
  @pm *create-prd                  # Product document
  ```
