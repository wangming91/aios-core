# Feature Request Process

This document explains how to propose new features for AIOS.

## Quick Ideas

For quick ideas or small improvements:

1. Open a Discussion in the "Ideas" category
2. Describe the problem and proposed solution
3. Community and maintainers will discuss
4. If there's interest, it may be promoted to RFC

## RFC Process (For Significant Features)

For larger features that require design decisions:

### When to Write an RFC

- New major features
- Breaking changes
- Significant architectural changes
- Changes affecting many users

### RFC Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Author writes RFC using our [RFC Template](/.github/RFC_TEMPLATE.md)
2. **Under Review**: 2-week comment period
3. **Decision**: Maintainers accept/reject
4. **Implementation**: If accepted, implementation begins

### Criteria for Acceptance

- Aligns with project vision
- Technically feasible
- Has clear implementation path
- Community demand demonstrated
- Maintainable long-term

## Voting

- Use :+1: reactions to show support
- Top-voted ideas are prioritized
- Maintainers have final decision

## Timeline

- Ideas: No fixed timeline
- RFCs: 2-week minimum review period
- Implementation: Based on roadmap capacity

### Who Can Add to Backlog?

The Product Owner (@po) is the sole authority for adding items to the internal backlog.
This ensures proper prioritization and alignment with project goals.

### Contributor Credit

Contributors whose ideas are implemented will be credited in:
- The CHANGELOG.md release notes
- The PR that implements the feature
- Our contributors page (if applicable)
