      Welcome to Synkra AIOS!

      AIOS is an AI-driven development framework that helps you:
        - Collaborate with specialized AI agents for development
        - Follow story-driven development workflows
        - Automate quality assurance

      Let's spend 5 minutes understanding the core concepts.

  # Step 2: Agent System
  - id: agents
    title: "Agent System"
    type: interactive

      AIOS uses specialized AI agents for different tasks:

      | Agent   | Role        | Use Case              |
      |---------|-------------|-----------------------|
      | @dev    | Developer   | Writing code          |
      | @qa     | QA Engineer | Testing & review      |
      | @architect | Architect | System design        |
      | @pm     | Product Mgr | Requirements          |
      | @devops | DevOps      | CI/CD & deployment    |

      Activate an agent by typing @agent-name in your conversation.

      Try it:
    action:
      type: command
      command: "aios agents list"
      label: "View All Agents"

  # Step 3: Story-Driven Development
  - id: stories
    title: "Story-Driven Development"
    type: interactive
    content: |
      AIOS organizes development through Stories:

        - Stories are requirements documents in docs/stories/
        - Each story has acceptance criteria and tasks
        - Agents implement stories following the criteria

      Story workflow:
        1. @po creates a story
        2. @dev implements the code
        3. @qa writes tests
        4. @devops deploys

      View active stories:
    action:
      type: command
      command: "aios story list"
      label: "View Active Stories"

  # Step 4: CLI Commands
